Cart.js is a Javascript library that makes it easy to add dynamic cart features to Shopify themes.

It abstracts away some of the difficulties of working with Shopify's AJAX API (such as the limited nature of some of the API endpoints and the need to make API calls synchronously) and provides a simple, consistent interface to manipulating a customer's cart.
