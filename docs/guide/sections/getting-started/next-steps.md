Now that you gotten Cart.js set up with your theme, you're ready to start using the library.
There are two main approaches to doing this.

The first way is to use the Core API methods on the global `CartJS` object from within your Javascript code.

The second is to use the in-built Data API to let Cart.js handle DOM events for you.

Both of these approaches are stepped through in the following walkthroughs.
Of course, these two approaches aren't mutually exclusive - you can always use the Data API for the majority of your cart functionality, and write more custom code using the Core API only when needed.

Finally, once you've gotten the hang of Cart.js, you might be interested in using it in conjunction with Rivets.js to create HTML templates that are automatically updated along with your cart.
There's a separate walkthrough taking you through that aspect of the library later on.
