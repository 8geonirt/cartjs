<p>Cart.js is a very small open source Javascript library that makes the addition of powerful Ajax cart functionality to your Shopify theme a breeze.</p>
<p>It&#39;s designed to be simple to use, while providing some really powerful and nifty features, like:</p>
<ul class="check-list">
    <li><strong>Simple, consistent API</strong> for cart manipulation;</li>
    <li><strong>Data-API</strong> for simple integration - just add <code>data-</code> attributes;</li>
    <li><strong>Two-way data binding</strong></li>
</ul>
</div><div class="col-md-6"><h3>Why should I use it?</h3>
<p>There are lots of things to consider when working with Shopify&#39;s Ajax API &mdash; the need for synchronous requests, maintaining line item properties, updating your page to make sure it stays in sync with your cart.</p>
<p>Cart.js handles all of this for you, without forcing any particular design paradigm on you.</p>
