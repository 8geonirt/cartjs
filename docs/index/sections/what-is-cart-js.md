### What is Cart.js?

Cart.js is a very small open source Javascript library that makes the addition of powerful Ajax cart functionality to your Shopify theme a breeze.

It's designed to be simple to use, while providing some really powerful and nifty features, like:

<ul class="check-list">
    <li><strong>Simple, consistent API</strong> for cart manipulation;</li>
    <li><strong>Data-API</strong> for simple integration - just add <code>data-</code> attributes;</li>
    <li><strong>Two-way data binding</strong></li>
</ul>
